ORIGIN
What’s left of those who have been possessed by their shadow. The possession consumes the connection between one’s mind and identity, leaving nothing but an inner void after the shadow relinquishes the body.

SYMPTOMS
Symptoms include the loss of identity, relationships, passions, and memories. May also include a persistent and unnatural coldness throughout the body. If left untreated, the affected will attempt societal reintegration and forge themselves an identity anew, driven by the need to have purpose.
