ORIGIN
A shadow curse given to those who fear aging or getting older. It is given to them by their shadows, who see their thoughts. It is most commonly found among those in the middle of their life.

SYMPTOMS
The main symptom of Merlinism is the instantaneous aging of oneâ€™s body to be a great age, while their mind remains unaffected. The cursed will experience an intense dissatisfaction with their new body.
