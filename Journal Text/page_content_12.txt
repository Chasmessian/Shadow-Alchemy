ORIGIN
Eating food or drink outside of its realm of creation, or while performing summoning magic, may tear open an interrealmatic vortex of insatiable hunger. Thus, if you are traveling to another realm, please do not, under any circumstances, pack yourself a lunch.

SYMPTOMS
The main symptom is the hunger that cannot be satisfied. The hunger may be unnoticeable at first, but it will increase in intensity indefinitely if left untreated. After about a week or less, the hunger becomes all-consuming and becomes physically paining, causing bodily aches and weakness.
