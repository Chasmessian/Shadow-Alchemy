ORIGIN
When traveling through portals or summoning from across realms without the appropriate charms, incidental exposure to the ancient chaos may occur, altering the travelerâ€™s perception of the world as if they were brought into a new, subtly different reality.

SYMPTOMS
Symptoms may be difficult to detect, as it may take the affected a long while before noticing anything out of the ordinary. Upon questioning, however, they will incorrectly recall the most basic of details about their reality, such as the color of the sky, song lyrics, or the names of their friends.
