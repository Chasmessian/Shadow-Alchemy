This journal will teach you how to cure your patients. Each patient has some curse and it is your job to figure out what it is and fix it. Talk to them, find clues, and scavenge the journal to see what matches the evidence. Then, read the instructions for the cure carefully. Enter the garden and plant the ingredients, watering them until they match what they look like in the seed selection menu. Then, mix them together precisely as the cure details.
