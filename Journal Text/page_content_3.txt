ORIGIN
This curse is the inevitable aftermath of being possessed by one of the shadowed ones. The possession consumes the connection between mind and identity, leaving nothing but an inner void after the shadowed one departs. 

SYMPTOMS
Those who have lost their identity will lose all of their relationships, passions, and names, becoming a blank slate human without a sense of purpose. Many also report a shivering, unnatural coldness that does not go away. If left untreated, they will try to reintegrate into society and forge themselves an identity anew, driven by that primal urge to have purpose.
