One important thing to keep in mind is that different species are allergic to different substances. Always remember to check to make sure you are not giving them a bad cure. They will have a substitute ingredient that you will use instead. You can find these allergies on the next few pages. The curses and their cures are the remaining pages after that

One other critical detail is ALWAYS ROUND DOWN, 5/2 = 2. In cases where this would result in 0 of an ingredient, use 1 instead as you can not administer 0 of an ingredient
