ORIGIN
A form of invasive otherworldly vine that hides itself as a seed within food products. Upon consumption, it takes hold and begins to grow with the body, its viny tendrils making their way to the nervous system. Not native to the mortal world.

SYMPTOMS
As the patientâ€™s mind is being siphoned from within the body, the cursed may be unable to recall memories of their life, and their motor skills will sharply decline. As such, they may be more susceptible to falling over, causing accidents, or thinking slowly.
