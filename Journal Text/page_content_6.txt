ORIGIN
A shadow curse given to those who spend too much time envying the lives of others. It is given to them by their shadows, who see their thoughts.

SYMPTOMS
Affected persons will likely have been transformed into another living thing, such as a mouse, a frog, or a cat, but in rarer cases they may have been transformed into inanimate objects, such as a broom or a chair. This symptom is noticeable.
