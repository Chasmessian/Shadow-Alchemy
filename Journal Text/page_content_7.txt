ORIGIN
A shadow curse given to those who fear being too emotional, or not emotional enough, in their decision-making. It is given to them by their shadows, who see their thoughts.

SYMPTOMS
Those afflicted with Frozenheart will suffer occasional, fluctuating periods of extreme coldness throughout their body lasting a few hours or so. Accompanying this coldness is a complete lack of empathy and emotion for the duration. Once warmth is returned to the body, the emotion returns as well, in some cases stronger than it was before.
