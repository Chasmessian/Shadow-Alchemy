ORIGIN
The curse of the werewolf. The curse is spread to the uninfected after being bitten by a werewolf, scratched by a werewolf, or making any contact with the blood of a werewolf.

SYMPTOMS
Symptoms may begin at any point after initial contact. Within the first day, the cursed may report increases in their senses of smell, sight, or hearing in addition to their overall strength. Within the first three days, symptoms may extend to difficulty sleeping, an increased appetite, and a craving for flesh. After about six days, the transformation will be complete, and the werewolf will involuntarily transform into a monstrous wolf-like aberration during the nighttime.
