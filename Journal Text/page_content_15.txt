ORIGIN
The curse of the vampire. The curse is spread to the uninfected after being bitten by a vampire, and by afterwards consuming some of the vampireâ€™s blood. Without the mutual exchange, the transformation will not occur.

SYMPTOMS
Symptoms may begin at any point after initial contact. Within the first three days, the cursed may develop sunlight sensitivity, garlic allergies, and a craving for human blood. After about seven days, the cursed may report an increase in their senses of smell, sight, or hearing, in addition to their overall strength, as well as the development of fangs. After ten days, the transformation will be complete, and the vampire may gain the ability to transform into a bat at will, though they now will burn in sunlight.
