ORIGIN
A shadow curse given to people who fear that they talk too much or who fear they do not talk enough. It is given to them by their shadows, who see their thoughts.

SYMPTOMS
The cursed is unable to speak freely, and is forced to repeat the last words they’ve heard spoken, thus, “the Curse of Echoes.”
