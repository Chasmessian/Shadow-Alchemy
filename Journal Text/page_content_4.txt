ORIGIN
Occasionally occurs when traveling between or summoning between the shadow realm and the mortal realm while not wearing the appropriate charms to guarantee safe passage.

SYMPTOMS
The symptoms are difficult to detect, as the Cursed may not detect anything out of the ordinary. However, upon questioning, they will recall even the most basic of details incorrectly (e.g. color of the sky, song lyrics, names of their friends). Usually requires an outsiderâ€™s assistance to notice the curse.
